## ðŸ“˜ JAVA ASSIGNMENT SET â€“ CLASS 12

### ðŸ”¹ **Assignment 1: Classes and Objects**
**Objective:** Understand object-oriented principles like encapsulation and method overloading.  
**Problem:**  
Create a class `Student` with attributes: `rollNo`, `name`, and `marks`.  
- Include a constructor to initialize the data.  
- Write methods to:
  - Display student details.
  - Calculate grade based on marks.  
**Extension:** Create an array of `Student` objects and print details of the student with the highest marks.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Assignment 2: Inheritance and Method Overriding**
**Objective:** Learn how subclasses extend base classes.  
**Problem:**  
Create a class `Employee` with name and basic salary. Derive a class `Manager` with additional allowance.  
- Override a method to calculate total salary.
- Display employee type and salary.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Assignment 3: File Handling (Text File)**
**Objective:** Master reading and writing text files using Java I/O.  
**Problem:**  
Write a program to:
- Accept names and marks of students from the user.
- Store them in a file named `marks.txt`.
- Read from the file and display students scoring more than 90%.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Assignment 4: Menu-Driven Application**
**Objective:** Build structured logic using switch-case or loops.  
**Problem:**  
Develop a menu-based program to:
1. Insert a record
2. View all records
3. Search for a record
4. Exit  
Use a class `Product` with attributes: product ID, name, and price. Use an `ArrayList` to store objects.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Assignment 5: Exception Handling**
**Objective:** Learn error management using `try-catch`.  
**Problem:**  
Create a program that accepts two numbers and divides them.  
- Handle divide-by-zero exception.
- Catch input mismatch exceptions (non-numeric input).

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Assignment 6: Simple GUI (Optional/Bonus)**
**Objective:** Introduce basic Java GUI with Swing or JavaFX.  
**Problem:**  
Create a basic calculator using GUI:
- Buttons for +, â€“, Ã—, Ã· operations.
- Text fields for input/output.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Assignment 7: Arrays and Sorting**
**Objective:** Learn sorting logic and array operations.  
**Problem:**  
- Accept 10 integers in an array.
- Sort the array in ascending order (Bubble/Selection Sort).
- Display sorted values and the median.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Assignment 8: Constructor Overloading**
**Objective:** Understand multiple constructors and their use.  
**Problem:**  
Create a class `Book` with:
- A default constructor initializing title and author to `"Unknown"`.
- A parameterized constructor that takes title and author as arguments.
- Display book details using both constructors.

---

## ðŸ“Ž SUBMISSION GUIDELINES:

  - Program code (well-indented and commented)
  - Sample output screenshot (if applicable)
  - Brief explanation of logic
- Save each program in a separate `.java` file
- Submit in hardcopy or digital folder as per instructor
